Project Proposal
## Sampletitle



This is our project proposal for the 1st quarter of CS3. The website we have in mind is a website that you can use to test your quirky skills in a series of fun minigames. This website is widely inspired by the website humanbenchmark.com which measures a human's skills through a bunch of tests. The tests involve memory, motor skills, and physical skills. The difference between their website and our's is that ours is worse and has minigames instead of just measuring someone's skills.

1. Typing test-A test that measures how fast you type in wpm (words per minute) by showing you a paragraph of text and a text box in which you can type the paragraph, it also measures the accuracy of your typing skills.
2. 8ball- A minigame that has a text box that lets you type a question in there in which the 8 ball will try to give you answers for that question.
3. CPS test- A test to measure your mouse click speed per second. There is a huge box that you'll try to click as fast as you can.
4. Reaction time test- a test to measure your reaction time in ms (milliseconds).
5. Aim test-A game to test your mouse aim. Three circles will show  up in a 8x8 grid and when clicked, will move to a new position on the grid. The objective is to try to click the most circles as fast and accurate as possible.
